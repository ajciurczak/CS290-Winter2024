1. https://estrella-journal.com/ very fun creative site with a lot of cool interactive elements, 
I don't love that the resume tab just sends you out to a google doc. Not super content heavy but short and sweet.
2. nationalgeographic.com I like the featured photos, titles of articles are only thing displayed no further 
info or author which I don't love. The menu also is not very graceful and just eats up your entire screen 
very quickly with the different pages, again with not a ton of detail
3. imdb.com not too much to say about the front page, lots of featured movies some lists seem repetitive. 
I really go here for the search features which are very useful for bringing up info
4. en.wikipedia.org very simple but packed with info, there's enough space between everything and drop downs 
are used a lot which I appreciate for ease of use. I love that along the left side there's a content menu to 
skip around in, also a random article function in the menu. most boring out of all of the choices here.
5. https://www.lomography.com/ I don't love how hitting the shop tab will open a whole new tab and it takes 
a while to load. I do love that they allow you to upload and tag film photos to share in a little community 
and explore, and I love the home page which has a changing featured artist every day. Visually pleasing 
setup for displaying lots and lots of photos.
